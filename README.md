This is a test implementation for the upcoming project "Abstract" which I will be doing.

I am testing a trial for image to html/css conversion:

Need to:

- Upload image
- Convert image through some processes
  \- OCR based text detection
  \- Image preprocessing
  \- Edge detection
  \- Contour detection (segmentation)
  \- Heuristic based component relation analysation
  \- Recreate HTML/CSS from the data
- Show it to user
